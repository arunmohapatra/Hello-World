Great questions — and very important when adopting any open-source platform like Spinnaker (Apache License 2.0).

Below is a clear explanation of what you can and don’t have to do when cloning, modifying, and using Spinnaker.

✅ 1. Can you clone Spinnaker and build your own Docker images?

Yes, 100% possible.

Spinnaker’s source is fully open under Apache 2.0, which explicitly allows:

✔ Cloning the code
✔ Modifying it
✔ Building your own binaries and images
✔ Using them internally in your organization
✔ Distributing custom versions (optional)

All Spinnaker microservices (Clouddriver, Orca, Gate, Deck, etc.) can be cloned and built as your own Docker images.

Many large companies do this:

Netflix

Airbnb

Snap

Salesforce

JPMorgan Chase (your org)

Adobe

✅ 2. If you make changes to the Spinnaker source code, do you have to contribute them back?

No.
Apache License 2.0 does NOT require you to contribute changes back.

Unlike GPL-style licenses, Apache 2.0 is business-friendly and allows private modifications.

✔ You are not obligated to:

Publish your changes

Open-source your internal code

Share patches with the upstream Spinnaker repo

Mention your modifications publicly

✔ You can keep everything private inside your organization.
📌 3. What does Apache 2.0 require from you then?

You only need to follow basic obligations:

(A) Provide NOTICE file if you redistribute Spinnaker publicly

If you ship Spinnaker externally (e.g., sell it, publish a fork), you must include a NOTICE file.

(B) Keep the license headers in the original source files

If you modify internal files, don’t delete the existing Apache license header.

(C) Attribute copyright in documentation if redistributing

Only required if distributing publicly, NOT internal use.

🏢 4. For internal enterprise use (your case)

You are completely free to:

✔ Fork Spinnaker
✔ Apply your organization-specific patches
✔ Modify UI, API, Clouddriver, pipelines
✔ Add custom stages and plugins
✔ Build your own container images
✔ Never share any changes externally

There is no legal requirement to send patches upstream.

🔧 5. How most enterprises customize Spinnaker
Option A — Using Plugins (Best Option)

Spinnaker supports plugins in Java/Kotlin and UI plugins.
Recommended because:

No need to fork code

No need to maintain custom builds

Easier upgrades

Option B — Forking the entire Spinnaker codebase

Used when:

Internal security requirements

Custom cloud providers

Custom deployment logic

Changes deep in Clouddriver/Orca

Most banks including JPMC do fork core services to add controls.

🔍 6. If you choose to contribute changes, it’s optional

You may open a PR to the upstream Spinnaker GitHub repo if you want, but:

❗ You are never forced to contribute.
❗ Your employment/company policy may prevent contributing anyway.

🎯 Final Answer Summary
Question	Answer
Can you clone & build your own Spinnaker images?	Yes
Can you modify the code for your environment?	Yes
Do you need to contribute changes back to open source?	No (not required under Apache 2.0)
Can you keep internal changes private?	Yes, fully allowed

==================================

Below is the clear, enterprise-friendly plan for cloning, modifying, and maintaining Spinnaker internally at JPMC.

✅ 1. Licensing: You Are Fully Allowed to Clone & Modify Spinnaker

Spinnaker is under Apache License 2.0, which allows:

✔ Cloning the full codebase
✔ Making internal modifications
✔ Building your own binaries / Docker images
✔ Storing everything privately inside JPMC
✔ Running your own customized distribution

There is no requirement to contribute changes back to the public repo.

This is exactly how large institutions use Spinnaker.

🏢 2. JPMC-specific Use Case (Typical Approach)

JPMC usually requires:

Security hardening

Custom policies

Compliance hooks

Special authentication logic

Custom Spinnaker stages

Extended cloud provider logic

Secret management changes

Logging/audit integration

Restricted image updates

Forking Spinnaker internally is the correct approach.

🛠 3. Recommended Architecture for Internal JPMC Fork
A. Fork the official repos on GitHub Enterprise (GHE)

Spinnaker consists of multiple repos:

clouddriver

orca

gate

deck

front50

fiat

rosco

igor

and more…

You should fork them into JPMC GitHub Enterprise to maintain everything internally.

B. Create an internal build pipeline (Jenkins or Tekton or Harness)

For each service:

Checkout from GHE

Build (Gradle for backend, Yarn for Deck)

Run tests

Build Docker image

Push image to JPMC’s internal Docker registry

🧩 4. Adding Internal JPMC Customizations

You can safely modify:

Backend Services (Java/Kotlin)

Add security validation to Gate/Fiat

Patch Clouddriver to add internal cloud providers

Modify Orca to enforce JPMC policies on pipeline execution

Add auditing hooks for controls

Customize Rosco for internal AMI creation rules

Deck (UI - React)

Add custom UI forms

Hide features not allowed in JPMC

Add compliance warnings

Integrate with JPMC SSO

Plugins

JPMC frequently uses plugins instead of modifying core services.
But since you said “internal changes,” forking is still fine.

🔄 5. Updating With New Spinnaker Releases

When a new release comes, your workflow is:

Pull upstream open-source updates

Merge into your fork

Resolve conflicts (especially in Clouddriver/Orca)

Rebuild internal Docker images

Test in an isolated Spinnaker staging environment

Roll out to production clusters

This is the standard enterprise update model.

🛡 6. Are you required to contribute your changes back?

No.

Under Apache 2.0:

You may keep all changes private

You don’t have to publish forks

You don’t have to upstream any patch

You don’t need to notify the Spinnaker community

You can have fully proprietary modifications

Only if JPMC publicly distributes its modified Spinnaker outside the company, they would need to attach a NOTICE file.
But for internal use, nothing is required.

🧭 7. Full Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

Here’s your high-level roadmap:

Step 1: Fork Repos

Fork all Spinnaker microservice repos into JPMC GitHub Enterprise.

Step 2: Set Up Internal Build

For each repo:

Backend

Build using Gradle

Publish JARs internally

Build Docker image with base JDK image

Frontend (Deck)

Build with Node + Yarn

Build for production

Bake into Docker image

Step 3: Maintain Custom Configuration Layers

Internal .properties and .yml

Internal endpoints

Internal authentication providers

Custom logging & metrics

Step 4: Internal Plugins (Optional but Recommended)

Example plugin types:

Custom Pipeline Stages

Custom Triggers

Custom Cloud Providers

Custom Deployment Handlers

Internal Approvals and Controls

Step 5: Deploy Your Internal Spinnaker

Deploy into:

Internal Kubernetes cluster

Using Helm or Operator

Use internal images

Handle updates safely

🎯 Final Summary

You can:

✔ Clone
✔ Modify
✔ Patch
✔ Build custom Docker images
✔ Keep everything internal to JPMC

You do not need to:

✘ Contribute back
✘ Publish your fork
✘ Expose internal changes
✘ Use open-source images

This approach is fully compliant with Apache License 2.0.

🔥 Exact Git commands to fork & maintain upstream sync
🔥 A complete internal build pipeline (Jenkins/Harness/Spinnaker itself)
🔥 Dockerfiles for each service

==================================

Is there any other open source tools like Spinnaker that i can explore for this  ??????????????????


Yes — there are several open-source Continuous Delivery platforms you can explore as alternatives or complements to Spinnaker.
Each has different strengths depending on your deployment model, scalability needs, and integration style.

Below is the definitive list of enterprise-class, open-source CD tools comparable to Spinnaker.

✅ 1. Argo CD (Very Popular for GitOps on Kubernetes)

License: Apache 2.0
Best for: Kubernetes-native GitOps

⭐ Why consider it?

Fastest-growing CD platform

Kubernetes-native (no VM support)

Simple architecture (controller + repo server)

Strong declarative approach

Amazing UI

Easy rollbacks

Supports progressive delivery via Argo Rollouts

👎 Limitations vs Spinnaker

Only pull-based GitOps

No direct multi-cloud VM deployment support

Pipelines (Argo Workflows) are separate components

If your workloads are mostly Kubernetes → explore Argo CD.

✅ 2. Tekton (Cloud Native Build/Delivery Pipelines)

License: Apache 2.0
Best for: Kubernetes-native CI/CD pipelines (like Jenkins X backend)

⭐ Why consider it?

CNCF project

Fully Kubernetes-native pipelines

Flexible custom tasks

Used by Google Cloud Build

Extensible operator model

👎 Limitations

No built-in deployment UI

Need Tekton Chains, Dashboard, Pipelines separately

No built-in multi-cloud deploy manager like Clouddriver

If you want K8s-native pipelines, Tekton is excellent.

✅ 3. FluxCD

License: Apache 2.0
Best for: Enterprise GitOps automation (secure, stable)

⭐ Why consider it?

CNCF project

Built-in image automation (auto-update Git repos)

Multi-cluster GitOps built in

Very stable and secure

👎 Limitations

No UI

Not a full-blown pipeline framework

No direct VM deployment

If you want secure GitOps without a GUI, Flux is strong.

✅ 4. Jenkins X

License: Apache 2.0
Best for: GitOps CI/CD with Tekton pipelines

⭐ Why consider it?

Automated CI/CD for Kubernetes

Uses Tekton underneath

Automated preview environments

GitOps integration

👎 Limitations

Complex

Large learning curve

Less mature than Argo CD

If you want CI + CD together in GitOps model → Jenkins X.

✅ 5. Keptn (SRE & progressive delivery automation)

License: Apache 2.0
Best for: Automated deployment + SLO validation

⭐ Why consider it?

Event-driven SRE platform

Automated chaos + validation + progressive rollout

Integrates with Argo, Jenkins, K8s

👎 Limitations

Not a full CD tool alone

Uses many moving parts

If you want Autonomous SRE pipelines → Keptn is great.

✅ 6. Harness CD Community Edition (Open Source Lite)

License: PolyForm (not fully open-source)

⭐ Why consider it?

Good UI

Canary/blue-green built-in

Kubernetes-focused

👎 Limitations

Not fully open source

No support for large multi-cloud deployments like Spinnaker

🏆 Closest Alternatives to Spinnaker by Feature

=================================================

we need multi cloud deployment using other deployment targets like aws lambda, ECS, EC2 in Azure functions, servers etc????


Got it — since your goal is multi-cloud deployments including AWS (Lambda, ECS, EC2), Azure Functions, VMs, and Kubernetes, this heavily favors Spinnaker over most GitOps-native tools like Argo CD or Tekton, because:

Argo CD / Flux / Tekton are Kubernetes-native, so they don’t natively support AWS Lambda / EC2 / ECS / Azure Functions / traditional servers.

Spinnaker’s Clouddriver handles multi-cloud deployments across AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, OpenStack, and even on-prem VMs.

Spinnaker supports blue/green, canary, rolling deployments across all these targets.

Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. Deployment Targets Spinnaker Supports
Cloud / Target	Supported?	Notes
AWS EC2	✅	Classic EC2 instances, ASGs
AWS ECS	✅	Containerized workloads
AWS Lambda	✅	Serverless functions
Azure Functions	✅	Serverless functions
Azure VMs	✅	VM Scale Sets
GCP Compute	✅	VM / GKE clusters
Kubernetes	✅	Any cluster, multiple namespaces
OpenStack / VMware	✅	On-prem VMs
Cloud Foundry	✅	Application deployments

So if your organization uses multiple clouds + serverless + Kubernetes, Spinnaker is the only open-source tool that natively supports all of them in a unified pipeline.

2. How Multi-Cloud Works in Spinnaker

Clouddriver manages accounts for each cloud provider.

AWS: IAM roles / credentials

Azure: Service principal / credentials

GCP: Service account JSON

Pipeline stages can target different clouds in the same pipeline.

E.g., first stage: deploy Lambda

Next stage: deploy EC2 ASG

Next stage: deploy Kubernetes app

Canary / Blue-Green works across clouds.

Artifacts (Docker images, ZIP packages, config files) are stored in cloud object stores and are accessible to all targets.

3. Pipeline Example for Multi-Cloud
Pipeline: HolidayApp Deployment
--------------------------------
1. Find Artifact (Docker image or ZIP for Lambda)
2. Deploy to AWS Lambda (stage)
3. Deploy to AWS ECS (stage)
4. Deploy to Azure Functions (stage)
5. Deploy to Azure VM (stage)
6. Run canary analysis (optional)
7. Manual approval
8. Rollout complete


This can all be managed in one Spinnaker pipeline with one UI, unlike Tekton / Argo CD where you’d need multiple clusters/repos.

4. Why Other Open-Source Tools Are Not Enough
Tool	Multi-cloud Support	Notes
Argo CD	❌	K8s-only
Argo Rollouts	❌	K8s-only
FluxCD	❌	K8s-only
Tekton	❌	K8s-only, can run serverless tasks but not deployment targets natively
Keptn	⚠	Focused on progressive delivery and SLO validation; needs upstream deploy tools

Conclusion: Only Spinnaker (OSS or Armory) meets the requirement out-of-the-box for multiple clouds + serverless + VMs + Kubernetes.

5. Enterprise Considerations

Fork Spinnaker internally (as we discussed) for compliance/security.

Internal Docker images for Clouddriver, Orca, Gate, etc.

Internal plugins for additional cloud integrations or policy enforcement.

Accounts setup for each cloud: AWS IAM roles, Azure service principals, GCP service accounts.

Artifact storage: S3 / GCS / internal registry accessible to all clouds.

✅ Recommendation

Use Spinnaker OSS or Armory Enterprise.

Configure all your cloud accounts in Clouddriver.

Deploy pipelines across AWS, Azure, and K8s using one unified interface.

For serverless (Lambda / Azure Functions) and VM deployments, Spinnaker is currently the only open-source option that fully supports these targets in one pipeline.

If you want, I can create a full multi-cloud Spinnaker architecture diagram for JPMC, showing:

AWS (EC2, ECS, Lambda)

Azure (VM, Functions)

Kubernetes clusters

Internal artifact storage

Pipeline orchestration

This will show exactly how your pipelines can deploy across all targets.

Do you want me to prepare that diagram?

You said:
what about gocd?
ChatGPT said:

Ah, yes — GoCD is another open-source CD tool you can consider. Let’s break it down in the context of your multi-cloud + serverless + VM + Kubernetes requirements.

1. What is GoCD?

Open-source, enterprise-grade Continuous Delivery tool

Developed by ThoughtWorks (Apache License 2.0)

Focused on modeling complex pipelines and dependency-based workflows

Supports pipeline-as-code with YAML or XML definitions

Strong in visualizing pipeline dependencies

2. GoCD Strengths

✅ Pipeline modeling & visualization

You can see exactly which stage depends on which artifact or pipeline

Good for large, multi-team pipelines

✅ CI/CD combined (can integrate with Jenkins / GitLab / Bamboo)

Can trigger builds and deployments

✅ Pipeline as code

Store your pipeline configuration in Git

✅ Agents for deployment

GoCD uses agents to run tasks on remote machines

Agents can be on-prem or in the cloud

3. GoCD Limitations for Your Use Case
Requirement	GoCD Support	Notes
Kubernetes deployment	✅	Via scripts (kubectl, Helm) on agents
AWS EC2 / ECS / Lambda	⚠ Partial	Must script deployment using CLI / SDK in pipeline stages; no native cloud provider integration like Spinnaker
Azure Functions / VMs	⚠ Partial	Must script using CLI / SDK
Multi-cloud orchestration	⚠ Partial	No native Clouddriver-like multi-cloud integration
Canary / Blue-Green	⚠ Partial	Can be implemented via scripted pipelines, but not built-in
4. Comparison With Spinnaker
Feature	Spinnaker	GoCD
Multi-cloud deployment	✅ Native	❌ Needs scripts
AWS Lambda / Azure Functions	✅ Native	❌ Script-based
Kubernetes	✅ Native	✅ Script-based
Canary / Blue-Green	✅ Native	⚠ Script-based
Pipeline visualization	✅ Good	✅ Excellent
Plugins / extensions	✅ Java plugins	✅ Custom tasks via scripts
5. Conclusion

GoCD is excellent if:

You want pipeline modeling & dependency visualization

Your deployments are mostly scriptable and you have infrastructure automation already in place

Spinnaker is better if:

You need multi-cloud + serverless + Kubernetes deployments

You want native canary, blue/green, rollback, progressive delivery

You want to avoid scripting each cloud provider manually

✅ Recommendation for Your Case (JPMC, multi-cloud + serverless)

GoCD can be used, but you will spend significant effort scripting AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, ECS, EC2, and Kubernetes deployments.

Spinnaker natively supports all your targets and is a more scalable solution for multi-cloud environments.

A hybrid approach is possible: GoCD for pipeline orchestration + Spinnaker for cloud-native deployments, but it adds complexity.

If you want, I can create a side-by-side architecture comparison showing Spinnaker vs GoCD for multi-cloud + serverless + VMs + Kubernetes deployments, with recommendations for JPMC’s setup.
