MCP Server for Spinnaker:
Setting up an MCP server involves creating an HTTP interface that translates standardized MCP 
requests into Spinnaker API calls. This enables AI agents to securely and efficiently interact 
with Spinnaker pipelines and workflows. Key tasks include mapping MCP contexts and intents to 
Spinnaker operations, handling authentication, enforcing validation and guardrails, 
and ensuring comprehensive logging and observability. Challenges include managing 
Spinnakerâ€™s API complexity, maintaining security, keeping up with evolving MCP standards, 
and enabling effective debugging.

MCP Protocol Pros and Cons:
The MCP protocol offers a standardized, language-agnostic way for AI agents to 
communicate with diverse systems via intent-context modeling, facilitating flexible integrations 
with minimal custom adapters. However, it is still an emerging standard with limited tooling and adoption, 
which may introduce instability and extra development effort during early implementation.
