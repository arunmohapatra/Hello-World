✅ Best Choice from Open Source

👉 Spinnaker

Why:

Only open-source CD tool that is truly multi-cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes)

Best-in-class deployment strategies (blue/green, canary, rolling)

Proven horizontal scalability in very large enterprises

Designed as a CD control plane, not just pipelines

Trade-offs (accepted in enterprise):

High operational complexity

Limited deep customization compared to Jenkins

No mainframe support

➡️ Conclusion:

If you must pick ONE open-source CD tool for enterprise scale, Spinnaker is the correct choice.

🏆 Best Choice for Self-Hosted Enterprise (Proprietary)

👉 IBM UrbanCode Deploy

Why:

Broadest deployment coverage: cloud, Kubernetes, on-prem, mainframe

Strongest governance, audit, approvals, compliance

Highly customizable and extensible

Operationally stable and predictable for long-term in-house ownership

Proven in Tier-1 banks and regulated environments

Trade-offs:

Not cloud-native by design

Canary deployments require customization

➡️ Conclusion:

If you must pick ONE self-hosted enterprise CD tool, IBM UrbanCode Deploy is the safest and most complete choice.
